'git-diffall' provides a directory-based diff mechanism for Git.

To determine what diff viewer is used, the script requires one of
the following to be true:

  - 'diff.tool' to be set in the user's configuration
  - 'merge.tool' to be set in the user's configuration
  - '--extcmd=<command>' to be given as an argument to 'git diffall'

This script is compatible with most common forms used to specify a
range of revisions to diff.

With the exception of '--extcmd=<command>', all arguments and
options are passed through to 'git diff --raw --no-abbrev -z'.

The '--extcmd=<command>' option allows the user to specify a custom
command for viewing diffs.  When given, 'diff.tool' and 'merge.tool'
are ignored and the script runs '$command $LOCAL $REMOTE'.

This script is based on an example provided by Thomas Rast on the
Git list [1]:
